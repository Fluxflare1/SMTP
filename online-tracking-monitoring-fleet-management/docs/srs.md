Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Online Tracking, Monitoring, and Fleet Management System. This system is designed to offer real-time tracking, monitoring, and fleet management services for businesses with transportation needs. The solution is a SaaS-based, modular, and customizable platform that integrates with third-party APIs and supports white-labeling.

1.2 Scope

The system will support functionalities for vehicle tracking, dispatcher operations, fleet management, and administrative control. The solution will also include APIs for integration with other services and customizable modules to ensure compatibility with client requirements.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

SaaS: Software as a Service

GPS: Global Positioning System

API: Application Programming Interface

CMS: Content Management System

TSP: Transportation Service Provider


1.4 System Overview

The system is built as a microservices architecture with a focus on modularity, allowing independent scalability and flexibility. It comprises several components, including an admin panel, dispatcher panel, tracking and monitoring modules, and fleet management capabilities.

2. System Description

2.1 System Environment

The system will be hosted on cloud infrastructure, supporting horizontal scalability and high availability. The backend services will be developed in Python/Django, while the frontend will use React.js. AWS LBS and Google Maps APIs will provide mapping and location services, and Docker containers will be used to facilitate deployments.

2.2 User Classes and Characteristics

1. Administrator: Manages users, vehicles, and permissions, oversees compliance, and reviews reports.


2. Dispatcher: Schedules trips, assigns drivers and vehicles, and monitors real-time status.


3. Driver: Views assigned trips, communicates with dispatchers, and submits trip data.


4. Fleet Manager: Manages vehicle inspection data, updates maintenance status, and oversees fleet performance and compliance.



2.3 Assumptions and Dependencies

Dependencies: External services, including AWS LBS, Google Maps, and third-party APIs for vehicle health monitoring and compliance.

Assumptions: High availability of cloud resources, regular updates from mapping APIs, and stable network connectivity for real-time tracking.
