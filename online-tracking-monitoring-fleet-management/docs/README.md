## Overview

The **Online Tracking, Monitoring, and Fleet Management System** is a SaaS-based solution designed to optimize vehicle tracking, fleet management, and driver monitoring for businesses in transportation and logistics. With real-time tracking, robust analytics, and flexible fleet management features, it helps users improve operational efficiency and ensure safety compliance across fleets.

This system is modular, highly scalable, and designed for ease of integration with third-party services. It includes an **Admin Panel** for settings and user management, a **Dispatcher Panel** for trip scheduling and vehicle assignment, and shared modules to support authentication, notifications, and reporting.

## Features

### Core Tracking and Monitoring
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor vehicle location on an interactive map.
- **Geofencing**: Define zones and receive alerts when vehicles leave these areas.
- **Route History**: Replay past routes for analysis.

### Fleet Management
- **Driver and Vehicle Management**: Assign drivers, manage vehicle details, and schedule maintenance.
- **Fuel Management**: Track fuel consumption and efficiency.
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Automated reminders for vehicle servicing.

### Alerts and Notifications
- Customizable alerts for events like unauthorized access, speeding, low fuel, maintenance, and geofence breaches.

### Reporting and Analytics
- Generate reports on fuel usage, driver behavior, fleet health, and trip summaries.

### Dispatcher Panel
- **Trip Scheduling**: Schedule and assign trips with estimated times of arrival.
- **Vehicle Status**: Monitor vehicle availability and status.

### Admin Panel
- **User and Role Management**: Manage permissions and roles across drivers, dispatchers, and admins.
- **Audit Logs**: Record user actions for security and compliance.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Maps**: AWS Location-Based Services (LBS), Google Maps API
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Notifications**: SMTP, SMS APIs
