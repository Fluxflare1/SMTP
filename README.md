Global Transportation Services

The Global Transportation Services Module offers passengers a single interface to book services from multiple transportation providers. This module interacts with the Transportation Services Management Hub, Online Tracking and Monitoring System, and Inspection Agent Portal to offer seamless multi-modal service bookings.

Features:

Global Booking: Passengers can search and book rides across various providers.

Tenant Integration: Tenants can opt-in to the global platform or run independent services.

Driver Registration: Independent drivers can sign up directly on the global platform.

Cross-Service Integration: Leverages the management hub to connect to various service providers.


White-Labeling for Tenants

The White-Labeling functionality allows tenants to offer transportation services under their own brand. Tenants can choose multiple services (e.g., ride-hailing, shuttle) and provide a unified interface for customers to book rides. Each tenant gets an independent dashboard to manage services, while also having the option to join the Global Platform for expanded service offerings.

Features:

Tenant Customization: Each tenant can fully brand their service offering.

Service Selection: Tenants can opt to offer any combination of transportation services.

Unified Booking Interface: Customers can book different services through one tenant-branded interface.

Opt-in Global Platform: Tenants can choose to join the global network or remain independent.
